Due to a time change in France, I forgot the lottery was one our earlier than usually. This 6th lottery therefore occurs at 01:00:00 UTC instead of 00:00:00 UTC. Since things are random, this should have no consequence over the result. I did not do this to cheat at the lottery since I always publicly (t.me/candlestake) give the .json associated with the lottery _before_ the seed to do the draws is known.
