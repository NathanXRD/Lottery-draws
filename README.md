# Lottery-draws
Lottery draws of [Candlestake.io](https://candlestake.io), staking service for Radix

## How to verify the results

The script determining the winner is `get-winner.py`.

It must be called like this: `python get-winner.py <seed> <path_to_candidates_csv> <n_winners>`.

`seed` is the random function seed, which will make the result reproducible and verifiable. Typically it will be the hash of the first Bitcoin block mined after the draw.

`path_to_candidates_json` is the path to a CSV extracted directly from the Radix API call named `account.get_info`.

A correct use would be:

```bash
python3 ./get-winner.py 0000000000000000000bb6435ae10d81d962a6714d9a6d1e8db3cee38303902f 'Draws\Sample\sample.csv' 2
```

Which displays:
```powershell
