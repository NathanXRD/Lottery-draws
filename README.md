# Lottery-draws
Lottery draws of [Candlestake.io](https://candlestake.io), staking service for Radix

## How to verify the results

The script determining the winner is `get-winner.py`.

It must be called like this: `python get-winner.py <seed> <path_to_candidates_json>`.

`seed` is the random function seed, which will make the result reproducible and verifiable. Typically it will be the hash of the first Bitcoin block mined after the draw.

`path_to_candidates_json` is the path to a JSON extracted directly from the Radix API call named `account.get_info`.

A correct use would be:

```bash
python3 ./get-winner.py 0000000000000000000bb6435ae10d81d962a6714d9a6d1e8db3cee38303902f './Draws/Sample draw - 17-08-2021/17-08-2021_00-00-00.json'
```

Which displays:
```bash
Winner: rdx1qspjc6z4kyv4t29gngn7g59cynx350wudaf02ax3cgscl2zdhc3k6lg905vac
Seed: 1121783408069534878293918418128988563240585841701261359
Stakes json: ./Draws/Sample draw - 17-08-2021/17-08-2021_00-00-00.json
```

In this case, the winning address is `rdx1qspjc6z4kyv4t29gngn7g59cynx350wudaf02ax3cgscl2zdhc3k6lg905vac`. Congratulations to them for winning this 0 XRD lottery! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

## Note

The lotteries from 1 to 9 (included) were performed using `Unused/get-winner-old.py`. Starting from the 10th lottery, the script called `get-winner.py` is the one we will use.
